Professional Boxing Association(PBA) was formed in 1998 as a traditional governing body. The PBA shifted to crossover boxing by forming influencer championship boxing which was to provide championship belts for misfits boxing in their first event(misfits x series 001) which took place on 27 August 2022.

The PBA managed to have a mutually benefitial relationship until their first fall out

The last stroll for the PBA and Misfits boxing was on initially on Friday 12th January 2024, on that day the PBA released a statement claiming they had suspended Misfits’ licence ,accusing the promotion of “[clear violations of the PBA’s rules and regulations](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ksi-logan-paul-dazn-tommy-fury-dillon-danis-b2430466.html)” and “bringing boxing into disrepute”. Misfits disputed the suggestion that its licence had been revoked, however, with a representative telling _The Independent_ that the promotion had “handed back” its licence.

Misfits later repeated that stance in [an official public statement ](https://twitter.com/misfitsboxing/status/1746206103438782606?s=46&t=Xne_X7RrH7NNqALszgnefA)on Saturday (13 January) afternoon and hinted they would be working with a new commission, saying: “ The safety and welfare of all fighters who participate in Misfits Boxing events, is, and will always be, the number one priority for the organisation.
