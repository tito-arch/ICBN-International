In recent years, there has been a growing trend in the world of boxing toward multi-fight deals. Instead of signing one-off deals for individual fights, many boxers are now opting to sign multi-fight contracts that secure their future in the sport and provide them with a steady stream of income.

One of the biggest benefits of multi-fight deals is that they offer boxers greater stability and security. With a multi-fight contract in place, a boxer knows that they will have a set number of fights lined up in the coming months and years, and can plan their training and preparation accordingly.

Another benefit of multi-fight deals is that they offer boxers a chance to build their reputation and brand. By signing a multi-fight contract, a boxer can build momentum and establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the sport. This can lead to increased exposure, higher paydays, and a greater chance of landing a major title fight in the future.

Multi-fight deals also benefit the promoter, who can plan their events and schedule with greater certainty. This allows them to build a stable and consistent roster of fighters, and to invest in the development and training of new talent.

The trend toward multi-fight deals has also been witnessed in cross-over boxing especially in promotions like Misfits boxing and Kingpyn boxing in the last few days. On the 10th of February 2023 Mams Taylor said that some fighters who have been contracted on a long term multifight deal will be loaned out to Kingpyn boxing , an example is Elle Brooke.

Here are some of the fighters with multi fight deals with either promotions.
