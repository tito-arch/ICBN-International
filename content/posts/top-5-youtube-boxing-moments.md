### 2._DEJI_ WINS HIS REDEMPTION FIGHT

Before this fight _Deji_ had lost three times to _Jake Paul, Vinnie Hacker_ and _Alex Wassabi_. It was paramount for him to win this fight. _JJ Olatunji_ better known as _K.S.I_ (_Deji_’s bother)did not believe that _Deji_ would actually win this fight taking into consideration he lost all his previous fights._Deji_’s opponent _FouseyTUBE_ was actually in good shape which prompted people to believe he would actually win this fight. Despite all the odds being against _Deji,_ he somehow managed to defeat _fouseyTUBE_ through a stoppage due to his opponent having a swollen eye. This was a very emotional win for _Deji_, his fans and family.

### 4._DEEN THE GREAT_ COMEBACK

_Deen the Great_ came in as the favourite in the fight, but despite this fact people still felt that there would be an upset in this fight. His opponent _Walid Sharks_ was the opponent some fans hoped would ”**humble**” _Deen The Great_ since they viewed him arrogant. During fight night, _walid_ appeared to have the upper hand, he actually knocked down _Deen the Great_ a few times. In the last round however _Deen_ managed to sneak in a punch that knocked _Walid_ out. This was the most unexpected comebacks during a fight in crossover boxing. A rematch was obvious at this point and people are actually excited for this to happen in a future misfits card.

### 5._SLIM_ WINS HIS FIGHT AGAINST _RYAN TAYLOR_

To actually know the reason why this win was so important to _Slim_ and his fans despite him being the favourite ,we have to go back to the 12th of June 2022 .On this fateful day _Slim Albaher_ got into an altercation with popular you tuber _Ryan Taylor_ in London which left slim having a bad eye injury. _Slim_ explained the whole situation on YouTube and what actually transpired. Fans were outraged at _Ryan Taylor_ for committing such an act.

On the 15th of October 2023 _Slim_ finally met _Ryan Taylor_ in the ring and he did not hold out. This was too personal to be lenient with _Ryan Taylor._ _Slim_ obviously won by unanimous decision but left _Ryan Taylor_ battered and to some that was justice right there. _Slim_ and _Ryan_ are friend now as of the writing of this article.
