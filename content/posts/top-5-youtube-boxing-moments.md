DEJI WINS HIS REDEMPTION FIGHT

Before this fight Deji had lost three times to Jake Paul, Vinnie Hacker and Alex Wassabi. It was paramount for him to win this fight. JJ Olatunji better known as K.S.I (Deji’s bother)did not believe that Deji would actually win this fight taking into consideration he lost all his previous fights.Deji’s opponent FouseyTUBE was actually in good shape which prompted people to believe he would actually win this fight. Despite all the odds being against Deji he somehow managed to defeat fouseyTUBE through a stoppage due to his opponent having a swollen eye. This was a very emotional win for Deji, his fans and family.

THE RETURN OF PINEDA

Misfits had a brilliant idea of having a mysterious opponent in Misfits X series 004.The anticipation and excitement from the fans grew day by day and this was the perfect atmosphere for his return. Despite losing his previous fight against K.S.I the fans still loved him and requested his involvement in up-coming misfits events. When fight night arrived it was time to finally reveal the mysterious opponent. The unexpected happened, Luis Alcaraz Pineda appeared and the crowd went wild.This moment was one of the best highlights of the whole card. Luis Alcaraz Pineda did not disappoint in his performance either, he actually won his fight by unanimous decision from the judges.

DEEN THE GREAT COMEBACK

Deen the Great came in as the favourite in the fight, but despite this fact people still felt that there would be an upset in this fight. His opponent Walid Sharks was the opponent some fans hoped would ”humble” Deen The Great since they viewed him arrogant. During fight night walid appeared to have the upper hand, he actually knocked down Deen the Great a few times. In the last round however Deen managed to sneak in a punch that knocked Walid out. This was the most unexpected comebacks during a fight in crossover boxing. A rematch was obvious at this point and people are actually excited for this to happen in a future misfits card.

SLIM WINS HIS FIGHT AGAINST RYAN TAYLOR

To actually know the reason why this win was so important to Slim and his fans despite him being the favourite ,we have to go back to the 12th of June 2022 .On this fateful day Slim Albaher got into an altercation with popular you tuber Ryan Taylor in London which left slim having a bad eye injury. Slim explained the whole situation on YouTube and what actually transpired. Fans were outraged at Ryan Taylor for committing such an act.

On the 15th of October 2023 Slim finally met Ryan Taylor in the ring and he did not hold out. This was too personal to be lenient with Ryan Taylor Slim obviously won by unanimous decision but left Ryan Taylor battered and to some that was justice right there. Slim and Ryan are friend now as of the writing of this article.
