Crossover boxing refers to instances where athletes from other sports have entered the boxing ring for a professional fight. This phenomenon has a long and storied history, dating back to the early days of modern boxing.

One of the most famous examples of a crossover athlete in boxing was James J. Corbett, a former champion heavyweight boxer who also had a successful stage career in vaudeville. More recently, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several high-profile crossover fights have taken place, featuring athletes such as former MMA star Anderson Silva, former professional wrestler Butterbean, and former mixed martial arts champion James Toney.

Crossover boxing events have been met with a mixed response from the boxing community, with some seeing them as a way to bring attention and new fans to the sport, while others view them as a dilution of the sport's tradition and skill. Regardless, crossover boxing events have been a recurring aspect of the sport's history and have often generated significant public interest and media attention.
