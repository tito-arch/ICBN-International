In the world of boxing, Jake Paul has become somewhat of a polarizing figure. Some see him as a self-promoting YouTube personality trying to make a quick buck in the sport, while others see him as a legitimate fighter with real potential. Regardless of where you fall on that spectrum, one thing is for sure: Jake Paul is making waves in the boxing world, and his upcoming fight against Tommy Fury on February 26th, 2023 in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia has the potential to propel him even further.

Recently, it was confirmed by the W.B.C (World Boxing Council) president Mauricio Sulaiman that if Jake Paul were to win the fight against Tommy Fury, he would be ranked in the cruiserweight division in the W.B.C records. This is a significant accomplishment for Paul, who has only fought four times professionally, and all against opponents with little to no professional experience.

For those unfamiliar with boxing weight classes, the cruiserweight division is for fighters who weigh between 175 and 200 pounds. This is a significant jump for Paul, who has been fighting at the light heavyweight level, which is for fighters between 168 and 175 pounds. Moving up a weight class could present new challenges for Paul, as the fighters in the cruiserweight division are typically larger and more experienced.

However, the fact that Paul is being considered for a ranking in the W.B.C records shows that he is being taken seriously as a fighter. It also opens up the possibility of him having a shot at the cruiserweight championship in the future. Of course, winning a single fight does not automatically earn someone a title shot, but it does put them in a better position to be considered for one.

It's worth noting that many boxing purists may scoff at the idea of Jake Paul being ranked in the W.B.C records or having a shot at a championship. They may argue that he hasn't fought any top-level opponents and that his success is more a result of his celebrity than his boxing ability. However, it's hard to deny that Paul has brought attention and interest to the sport, which can only be a good thing for boxing as a whole.

In conclusion, if Jake Paul is able to beat Tommy Fury on February 26th, 2023 in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, he will be ranked in the cruiserweight division in the W.B.C records. There's no denying that he's making waves in the boxing world and bringing more attention to the sport.
