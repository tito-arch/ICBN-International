<p>Fox found his success through the youtube boxing scene.  His first video about youtube boxing was on the 19th of May 2021. The video was about Bryce Hall having the thought of beating K.S.I.

<p>However, on the 25th of July 2021, Fox got some eyeballs to his channel when he met the popular British YouTuber K.S.I and asked him to honor a promise he made of going bald if he got a number-one album in the official charts. This was a defining moment for Fox. The video currently stands at <strong>1,280,947</strong> views and <strong>82k</strong> likes.</p>
